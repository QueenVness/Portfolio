One thing that comes to your notice is that there are perhaps courses that are not filed under the 'Machine Learning' category but could still be considered 'Machine Learning.'

Perhaps there is a pocket of courses that can be improved and we can lift the average that way. You decide to dig deeper and see if you can find pockets of underperformance. You instintctively want  to explore if the size of a course (number of learners) has some correlation with the nps - this is q_4_2 from week 1.

You decide to investigate this and see if somehow the nps was correlated to this combination of the length of the course and the level of the course."
